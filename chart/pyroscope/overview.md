## About Pyroscope

Grafana Pyroscope is a continuous profiling platform designed to surface performance insights from your applications,
helping you optimize resource usage such as CPU, memory, and I/O operations. With Pyroscope, you can both proactively
and reactively address performance bottlenecks across your system.

The typical use cases are:

- Proactive: Reducing resource consumption, improving application performance, or preventing latency issues.
- Reactive: Quickly resolving incidents with line-level detail and debugging active CPU, memory, or I/O bottlenecks.

Pyroscope provides powerful tools to give you a comprehensive view of your application's behavior while allowing you to
drill down into specific services for more targeted root cause analysis.
