## About FRRouting

FRRouting (FRR) is a free and open source routing protocol suite for Linux and Unix platforms. FRR implements major
routing protocols including BGP, OSPF (v2 and v3), IS-IS, RIP, EIGRP, NHRP, PIM, LDP, BFD, Babel, PBR, and VRRP. This
Docker Hardened Image packages the complete FRR routing stack with all protocol daemons, the vtysh integrated shell, and
watchfrr process monitor in a secure, minimal runtime.

FRR is designed for network operators running routing on Linux-based routers, data center switches, cloud
infrastructure, and Kubernetes network fabrics. It provides enterprise-grade routing with a modular architecture that
allows running only the required protocol daemons. Typical use cases include BGP peering, OSPF routing in data centers,
network automation labs, container networking with BGP, and SD-WAN implementations.
