## About BATS

BATS (Bash Automated Testing System) is a TAP-compliant testing framework for Bash. It provides a simple way to verify
that UNIX programs behave as expected. Tests are written in Bash with a simple syntax, making them easy to read and
maintain.

BATS is most useful when testing software written in Bash, but you can use it to test any UNIX program.
