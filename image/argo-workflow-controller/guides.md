## How to use this image

All examples in this guide use the public image. If you’ve mirrored the repository for your own use (for example, to
your Docker Hub namespace), update your commands to reference the mirrored image instead of the public one.

For example:

- Public image: `dhi.io/<repository>:<tag>`
- Mirrored image: `<your-namespace>/dhi-<repository>:<tag>`

For the examples, you must first use `docker login dhi.io` to authenticate to the registry to pull the images.

### What's included in this Argo Workflow Controller Hardened Image

This image contains the following tools:

- `workflow-controller`: The Argo Workflow controller for managing workflow execution.

The entry point for the image is `workflow-controller` and you must specify the command to run.

### Use Argo Workflows in Kubernetes

To use the Argo Workflows hardened image in Kubernetes, [set up authentication](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/how-to/k8s/)
and update your Kubernetes deployment. For example, in your `workflow-controller.yaml` file, replace the image reference
in the container spec. In the following example replace `<tag>` with the desired tag. Also, include the command to run
the `workflow-controller`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: argo-workflow-controller
  namespace: argo
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: workflow-controller
          image: dhi.io/argo-workflow-controller:<tag>
          command: ["workflow-controller"]
        imagePullSecrets:
          - name: <your-registry-secret>
```

Then apply the manifest to your Kubernetes cluster.

```console
$ kubectl create namespace argo
$ kubectl apply -n argo -f workflow-controller.yaml
```

For examples of how to use Argo Workflows itself, see the
[Argo Workflows documentation](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Install Argo Workflows using Helm

You can install Argo Workflows using the official helm chart and replace the image. Replace `<your-registry-secret>`
with your [Kubernetes image pull secret](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/how-to/k8s/) and `<tag>` with the desired image
tag.

```bash
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm repo update

helm upgrade --install argo-workflows argo/argo-workflows \
  -n argo-workflows --create-namespace --wait \
  --set "images.pullSecrets[0].name=<your-registry-secret>" \
  --set controller.image.registry=dhi.io \
  --set controller.image.repository=argo-workflow-controller \
  --set controller.image.tag=<tag>
```

## Non-hardened images vs Docker Hardened Images

### Key differences

| Feature         | Non-hardened Argo Workflows         | Docker Hardened Argo Workflows                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Security        | Standard base with common utilities | Minimal, hardened base with security patches        |
| Shell access    | Full shell (bash/sh) available      | No shell in runtime variants                        |
| Package manager | apt/apk available                   | No package manager in runtime variants              |
| User            | Runs as root by default             | Runs as nonroot user                                |
| Attack surface  | Larger due to additional utilities  | Minimal, only essential components                  |
| Debugging       | Traditional shell debugging         | Use Docker Debug or Image Mount for troubleshooting |

### Why no shell or package manager?

Docker Hardened Images prioritize security through minimalism:

- Reduced attack surface: Fewer binaries mean fewer potential vulnerabilities
- Immutable infrastructure: Runtime containers shouldn't be modified after deployment
- Compliance ready: Meets strict security requirements for regulated environments

The hardened images intended for runtime don't contain a shell nor any tools for debugging. Common debugging methods for
applications built with Docker Hardened Images include:

- [Docker Debug](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/debug/) to attach to containers
- Docker's Image Mount feature to mount debugging tools
- Ecosystem-specific debugging approaches

Docker Debug provides a shell, common debugging tools, and lets you install other tools in an ephemeral, writable layer
that only exists during the debugging session.

For example, you can use Docker Debug:

```
docker debug <image-name>
```

or mount debugging tools with the Image Mount feature:

```
docker run --rm -it --pid container:my-container \
  --mount=type=image,source=dhi.io/busybox,destination=/dbg,ro \
  dhi.io/argo-workflow-controller:<tag> /dbg/bin/sh
```

## Image variants

Docker Hardened Images come in different variants depending on their intended use.

Runtime variants are designed to run your application in production. These images are intended to be used either
directly or as the `FROM` image in the final stage of a multi-stage build. These images typically:

- Run as the nonroot user
- Do not include a shell or a package manager
- Contain only the minimal set of libraries needed to run the app

Build-time variants typically include `dev` in the variant name and are intended for use in the first stage of a
multi-stage Dockerfile. These images typically:

- Run as the root user
- Include a shell and package manager
- Are used to build or compile applications

## Migrate to a Docker Hardened Image

Switching to the hardened Argo Workflows image does not require any special changes. You can use it as a drop-in
replacement for the standard Argo Workflows (`argoproj/workflow-controller`) image in your existing workflows and
configurations. Note that the entry point for the hardened image may differ from the standard image, so ensure that your
commands and arguments are compatible.

### Migration steps

1. Update your image reference. Replace the image reference in your Docker run command or Compose file:
   - From: `argoproj/workflow-controller:<tag>`
   - To: `dhi.io/argo-workflow-controller:<tag>`
1. Specify the command to run `workflow-controller`. All your existing environment variables, volume mounts, and network
   settings remain the same.

### General migration considerations

While the specific configuration requires no changes, be aware of these general differences in Docker Hardened Images:

| Item            | Migration note                                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shell access    | No shell in runtime variants, use Docker Debug for troubleshooting     |
| Package manager | No package manager in runtime variants                                 |
| Debugging       | Use Docker Debug or Image Mount instead of traditional shell debugging |

## Troubleshoot migration

### General debugging

The hardened images intended for runtime don't contain a shell nor any tools for debugging. The recommended method for
debugging applications built with Docker Hardened Images is to use
[Docker Debug](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/debug/) to attach to these containers. Docker Debug
provides a shell, common debugging tools, and lets you install other tools in an ephemeral, writable layer that only
exists during the debugging session.

### Permissions

By default image variants intended for runtime, run as the nonroot user. Ensure that necessary files and directories are
accessible to the nonroot user. You may need to copy files to different directories or change permissions so your
application running as the nonroot user can access them.

### Privileged ports

Non-dev hardened images run as a nonroot user by default. As a result, applications in these images can't bind to
privileged ports (below 1024) when running in Kubernetes or in Docker Engine versions older than 20.10.

### No shell

By default, image variants intended for runtime don't contain a shell. Use dev images in build stages to run shell
commands and then copy any necessary artifacts into the runtime stage. In addition, use Docker Debug to debug containers
with no shell.

### Entry point

Docker Hardened Images may have different entry points than images such as Docker Official Images. Use `docker inspect`
to inspect entry points for Docker Hardened Images and update your Dockerfile if necessary.
