## How to use this image

All examples in this guide use the public image. If you’ve mirrored the repository for your own use (for example, to
your Docker Hub namespace), update your commands to reference the mirrored image instead of the public one.

For example:

- Public image: `dhi.io/<repository>:<tag>`
- Mirrored image: `<your-namespace>/dhi-<repository>:<tag>`

For the examples, you must first use `docker login dhi.io` to authenticate to the registry to pull the images.

### What's included in this Hyperledger Fabric Tools Hardened image

Hyperledger Fabric Tools is a collection of command-line utilities for managing and configuring Hyperledger Fabric
blockchain networks. This hardened image includes six essential tools: `configtxgen` for generating channel
configuration artifacts, `configtxlator` for translating configuration between binary and JSON formats, `cryptogen` for
generating cryptographic key material, `discover` for service discovery, `ledgerutil` for ledger maintenance operations,
and `osnadmin` for managing orderer channels. The hardened image provides the same functionality as upstream Hyperledger
Fabric but runs with Docker Hardened Image security guarantees.

These tools are primarily used during network setup, configuration updates, and maintenance operations. They enable
administrators to create genesis blocks, generate channel transaction configurations, manage cryptographic identities,
inspect and modify channel configurations, and perform administrative tasks on orderer nodes.

## Using Hyperledger Fabric Tools

Run commands using `docker run` with Hyperledger Fabric Tools. Replace `<tag>` with the desired version.

```bash
docker run --rm dhi.io/hyperledger-fabric-tools:<tag> configtxgen -version
```

Generate a sample cryptogen configuration template and save it to a file:

```bash
docker run --rm dhi.io/hyperledger-fabric-tools:<tag> cryptogen showtemplate > crypto-config.yaml
```

To use tools with configuration files, mount directories and use volume mounts. For example, generate cryptographic
material with cryptogen:

```bash
# Generate crypto material using the template
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/work \
  dhi.io/hyperledger-fabric-tools:<tag> \
  cryptogen generate --config=/work/crypto-config.yaml --output=/work/crypto-config
```

This command generates X.509 certificates and keys for orderers and peers based on the `crypto-config.yaml`
specification. The output is written to the `crypto-config` directory on your host. For tools like `configtxgen` that
use `FABRIC_CFG_PATH`, mount your config directory with `-v` and set the environment variable with
`-e FABRIC_CFG_PATH=/config`.

## Hardened image debugging

Docker Hardened Images for Hyperledger Fabric Tools do not include a shell or package manager to minimize the attack
surface and reduce image size. This means you cannot use `docker exec` to access a shell inside a running container.
However, Docker provides alternative debugging methods that work seamlessly with hardened images.

The recommended approach is to use [Docker Debug](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/debug/), which attaches
an ephemeral debug container with a shell and common debugging tools to your running container. This allows you to
inspect the container's filesystem, processes, and network configuration without modifying the production image.

For Hyperledger Fabric Tools specifically, you can also debug by examining the output artifacts (genesis blocks,
configuration files, certificates) generated by the tools. Mount volumes to persist these outputs and inspect them on
your host system. Additionally, enable verbose logging by checking tool-specific flags (many tools support `-v` or
`--verbose` flags).

### Using Docker Debug

Attach a debug shell to a running Hyperledger Fabric Tools container:

```bash
docker debug <container-name>
```

This opens a shell in the debug container where you can inspect the filesystem, check running processes with `ps`, or
examine network connections with `netstat`.

### Using Docker Image Mount

Mount the container's filesystem to your host for inspection:

```bash
docker image mount dhi.io/hyperledger-fabric-tools:<tag> /mnt/inspect
ls -la /mnt/inspect/usr/local/bin/
```

### Examining generated artifacts

Since the tools generate configuration files and cryptographic material, debug by inspecting outputs:

```bash
# Generate crypto material
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work \
  dhi.io/hyperledger-fabric-tools:<tag> \
  cryptogen generate --config=/work/crypto-config.yaml --output=/work/crypto-config

# Inspect the generated certificates on your host
ls -la crypto-config/peerOrganizations/
openssl x509 -in crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/ca/ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem -text -noout | head -20
```

## Image variants

Docker Hardened Images come in different variants depending on their intended use.

- Runtime variants are designed to run your application in production. These images are intended to be used either
  directly or as the `FROM` image in the final stage of a multi-stage build. These images typically:

  - Run as the nonroot user
  - Do not include a shell or a package manager
  - Contain only the minimal set of libraries needed to run the app

- Build-time variants typically include `dev` in the variant name and are intended for use in the first stage of a
  multi-stage Dockerfile. These images typically:

  - Run as the root user
  - Include a shell and package manager
  - Are used to build or compile applications

## Migrate to a Docker Hardened Image

To migrate your application to a Docker Hardened Image, you must update your Dockerfile. At minimum, you must update the
base image in your existing Dockerfile to a Docker Hardened Image. This and a few other common changes are listed in the
following table of migration notes.

| Item               | Migration note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base image         | Replace your base images in your Dockerfile with a Docker Hardened Image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Package management | Non-dev images, intended for runtime, don't contain package managers. Use package managers only in images with a `dev` tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Non-root user      | By default, non-dev images, intended for runtime, run as the nonroot user. Ensure that necessary files and directories are accessible to the nonroot user.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Multi-stage build  | Utilize images with a `dev` tag for build stages and non-dev images for runtime. For binary executables, use a `static` image for runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| TLS certificates   | Docker Hardened Images contain standard TLS certificates by default. There is no need to install TLS certificates.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ports              | Non-dev hardened images run as a nonroot user by default. As a result, applications in these images can't bind to privileged ports (below 1024) when running in Kubernetes or in Docker Engine versions older than 20.10. To avoid issues, configure your application to listen on port 1025 or higher inside the container. |
| Entry point        | Docker Hardened Images may have different entry points than images such as Docker Official Images. Inspect entry points for Docker Hardened Images and update your Dockerfile if necessary.                                                                                                                                  |
| No shell           | By default, non-dev images, intended for runtime, don't contain a shell. Use dev images in build stages to run shell commands and then copy artifacts to the runtime stage.                                                                                                                                                  |

The following steps outline the general migration process.

1. Find hardened images for your app.

   A hardened image may have several variants. Inspect the image tags and find the image variant that meets your needs.

1. Update the base image in your Dockerfile.

   Update the base image in your application's Dockerfile to the hardened image you found in the previous step. For
   framework images, this is typically going to be an image tagged as `dev` because it has the tools needed to install
   packages and dependencies.

1. For multi-stage Dockerfiles, update the runtime image in your Dockerfile.

   To ensure that your final image is as minimal as possible, you should use a multi-stage build. All stages in your
   Dockerfile should use a hardened image. While intermediary stages will typically use images tagged as `dev`, your
   final runtime stage should use a non-dev image variant.

1. Install additional packages

   Docker Hardened Images contain minimal packages in order to reduce the potential attack surface. You may need to
   install additional packages in your Dockerfile. Inspect the image variants to identify which packages are already
   installed.

   Only images tagged as `dev` typically have package managers. You should use a multi-stage Dockerfile to install the
   packages. Install the packages in the build stage that uses a `dev` image. Then, if needed, copy any necessary
   artifacts to the runtime stage that uses a non-dev image.

   For Alpine-based images, you can use `apk` to install packages. For Debian-based images, you can use `apt-get` to
   install packages.

## Troubleshooting migration

The following are common issues that you may encounter during migration.

### General debugging

The hardened images intended for runtime don't contain a shell nor any tools for debugging. The recommended method for
debugging applications built with Docker Hardened Images is to use
[Docker Debug](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/debug/) to attach to these containers. Docker Debug provides
a shell, common debugging tools, and lets you install other tools in an ephemeral, writable layer that only exists
during the debugging session.

### Permissions

By default image variants intended for runtime, run as the nonroot user. Ensure that necessary files and directories are
accessible to the nonroot user. You may need to copy files to different directories or change permissions so your
application running as the nonroot user can access them.

### Privileged ports

### No shell

By default, image variants intended for runtime don't contain a shell. Use `dev` images in build stages to run shell
commands and then copy any necessary artifacts into the runtime stage. In addition, use Docker Debug to debug containers
with no shell.

### Entry point

Docker Hardened Images may have different entry points than images such as Docker Official Images. Use `docker inspect`
to inspect entry points for Docker Hardened Images and update your Dockerfile if necessary.
