## About Goldilocks

Goldilocks is a Kubernetes utility that helps you identify a starting point for resource requests and limits by
leveraging Vertical Pod Autoscalers (VPA) in recommendation mode. The utility consists of two main components: a
controller that automatically creates VPA objects for labeled namespaces, and a web dashboard that displays resource
recommendations.
