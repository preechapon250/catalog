## About Perl

Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language known for its text processing
capabilities and extensive CPAN ecosystem. Perl supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, and provides
powerful built-in features for text manipulation, system administration, and network programming. Perl's philosophy
emphasizes ease of use and practicality, making it a popular choice for system administration, web development, and
network automation tasks.

## About CPAN

CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) is the canonical software repository for Perl, hosting over 250,000 modules
written by more than 14,000 contributors. The CPAN ecosystem provides Perl developers with a vast collection of reusable
code for virtually any task, from web frameworks to scientific computing.

Docker Hardened Perl images include cpanminus (cpanm), a lightweight, zero-dependency CPAN client that makes installing
Perl modules fast and easy. Additionally, Net::SSLeay and IO::Socket::SSL are pre-installed to provide robust SSL/TLS
support for secure network communication.
