## Prerequisites

All examples in this guide use the public image. If you’ve mirrored the repository for your own use (for example, to
your Docker Hub namespace), update your commands to reference the mirrored image instead of the public one.

For example:

- Public image: `dhi.io/<repository>:<tag>`
- Mirrored image: `<your-namespace>/dhi-<repository>:<tag>`

For the examples, you must first use `docker login dhi.io` to authenticate to the registry to pull the images.

## What's included in this pushgateway image

This Docker Hardened pushgateway image includes:

- The `pushgateway` binary (statically built) installed at `/bin/pushgateway`.
- Minimal runtime filesystem prepared for secure execution as a nonroot user.

## Start a pushgateway image

The Pushgateway listens on port 9091 by default. Use the following examples to run the hardened image.

### Basic usage

```bash
$ docker run -d --name pushgateway -p 9091:9091 \
  dhi.io/pushgateway:<tag>
```

To pass command-line flags to the Pushgateway (for example to change the listen address or enable persistence), append
them after the image name:

```bash
$ docker run -d --name pushgateway -p 9091:9091 \
  dhi.io/pushgateway:<tag> --web.listen-address=":9091" --persistence.file=/data/pushgateway.snap
```

### Docker Compose example

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  pushgateway:
    image: dhi.io/pushgateway:<tag>
    container_name: pushgateway
    ports:
      - "9091:9091"
    volumes:
      - ./pushgateway-data:/data
    command:
      - "--web.listen-address=:9091"
      - "--persistence.file=/data/pushgateway.snap"

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    container_name: prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml:ro
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
```

A minimal prometheus.yml to scrape the Pushgateway:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'pushgateway'
    honor_labels: true
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['pushgateway:9091']
```

### Environment / configuration

Pushgateway is configured primarily via command-line flags (not environment variables). The hardened image does not
introduce custom environment variables for configuration. Common flags include:

| Flag                 | Description                                                                | Example                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| --web.listen-address | Address and port to listen on                                              | ":9091"                  |
| --persistence.file   | Path to a file where metrics are persisted across restarts                 | "/data/pushgateway.snap" |
| --web.route-prefix   | Prefix at which the web UI and metrics are served (if used behind a proxy) | "/"                      |

You can pass flags directly as arguments to the container (see examples above).

## Common pushgateway use cases

- Basic local testing: run a single container and push metrics from short-lived jobs.

  Push a metric with curl:

  ```bash
  echo "some_metric 3.14" | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/some_job
  ```

- Persisted Pushgateway: mount a host volume for persistence and pass `--persistence.file` so metrics survive restarts:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name pushgateway -p 9091:9091 \
    -v /var/lib/pushgateway:/data \
    dhi.io/pushgateway:<tag> --persistence.file=/data/pushgateway.snap
  ```

- Prometheus + Pushgateway in Compose: use the Compose example above and configure Prometheus to scrape the Pushgateway.
  Be sure to set `honor_labels: true` in Prometheus' scrape config to avoid overwritten job/instance labels.

## Example: Pushing metrics from a shell script

A simple shell script that pushes a metric (note the newline at end of each metric line):

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "batch_job_success 1" | curl --data-binary @- http://pushgateway:9091/metrics/job/batch_job
```

## Important operational notes

- Pushgateway is intended for service-level, ephemeral, or batch-job metrics. It is not a general aggregation system or
  event store. See the upstream docs for guidance on correct usage: https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway and
  https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/.

- The Pushgateway adds `push_time_seconds` and `push_failure_time_seconds` metrics for each metric group. These can be
  useful for alerting on stale or failed pushes.

- The hardened runtime runs the binary as a nonroot user. Avoid binding to privileged ports inside the container
  (\<1024) unless using a dev/runtime image that supports it.

## Image details

- Default listen port: 9091/tcp
- Entrypoint: `/bin/pushgateway`
- Working directory: `/pushgateway`
- Runs as nonroot user (UID 65534)

## Image variants

Docker Hardened Images come in different variants depending on their intended use. Image variants are identified by
their tag.

- Runtime variants are designed to run your application in production. These images are intended to be used either
  directly or as the FROM image in the final stage of a multi-stage build. These images typically:

  - Run as a nonroot user
  - Do not include a shell or a package manager
  - Contain only the minimal set of libraries needed to run the app

- Build-time variants typically include `dev` in the tag name and are intended for use in the first stage of a
  multi-stage Dockerfile. These images typically:

  - Run as the root user
  - Include a shell and package manager
  - Are used to build or compile applications

To view the image variants and get more information about them, select the Tags tab for this repository, and then select
a tag.

## Migrate to a Docker Hardened Image

To migrate your application to a Docker Hardened Image, you must update your Dockerfile. At minimum, you must update the
base image in your existing Dockerfile to a Docker Hardened Image. This and a few other common changes are listed in the
following table of migration notes.
