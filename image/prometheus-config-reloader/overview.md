## About Prometheus Config Reloader

The Prometheus Config Reloader is used in combination with the Prometheus Operator to provide Kubernetes native
deployment and management of Prometheus and related monitoring components. The operator simplifies the deployment and
configuration of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related monitoring components by providing Kubernetes custom resources
for declarative configuration. It enables organizations to run highly available monitoring infrastructure with minimal
manual intervention. The config reloader facilitates the reloading of Prometheus configuration changes without downtime.
