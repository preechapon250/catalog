  display-name: OpenTelemetry Target Allocator
  short-description: |
    The Target Allocator (TA) is an optional component of the OpenTelemetry Operator that discovers Prometheus targets
    and shards them across a fleet of OpenTelemetry Collector instances. It provides HTTP endpoints that Collectors use
    to fetch their assigned scrape targets (e.g. /jobs, /jobs/{job}/targets, /scrape_configs) and supports config-file
    and CR-based discovery.
