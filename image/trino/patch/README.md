The goal of the ch-guava-grpc.patch is to fix CVEs by:

- Modifying the clickhouse-jdbc dependency removing the `all` classifier and excluding it's dependency on
  guava@29.0-android, because this version of guava contains CVE-2023-2976 and CVE-2020-8908. By excluding it,
  clickhouse-jdbc will automatically use the more recent guava dependency which is anyways included by trino. The `all`
  classifier had to be removed in order to make the exclusion work.

- Bumping the grpc dependencies to fix CVE-2025-55163

This patch has been generated by making the above changes in the files mentioned in the patch to the trino source code
in version 478 and executing `git diff` on the modified files.
