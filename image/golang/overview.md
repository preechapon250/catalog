## About Go

Go (a.k.a., Golang) is a programming language first developed at Google. It is a statically-typed language with syntax
loosely derived from C, but with additional features such as garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing
capabilities, additional built-in types (e.g., variable-length arrays and key-value maps), and a large standard library.
