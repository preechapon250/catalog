## How to use this image

All examples in this guide use the public image. If you’ve mirrored the repository for your own use (for example, to
your Docker Hub namespace), update your commands to reference the mirrored image instead of the public one.

For example:

- Public image: `dhi.io/<repository>:<tag>`
- Mirrored image: `<your-namespace>/dhi-<repository>:<tag>`

For the examples, you must first use `docker login dhi.io` to authenticate to the registry to pull the images.

## Start an Istio CNI image

First follow the
[authentication instructions for DHI in Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/how-to/k8s/#authentication).

The Istio CNI image runs as a **DaemonSet** on each node in your Kubernetes cluster. It installs the CNI plugin binary
and manages pod network namespace configuration. This image cannot be run standalone.

Replace `<secret name>` with your Kubernetes image pull secret and `<tag>` with the image variant you want to use.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: istio-cni-node
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: istio-cni-node
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: istio-cni-node
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: <secret name>
      containers:
      - name: install-cni
        image: dhi.io/istio-install-cni:<tag>
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
```

## Common Istio CNI use cases

### Sidecar mode networking

The CNI plugin configures iptables rules for traffic redirection when pods with Istio sidecars are scheduled,
eliminating the need for privileged init containers.

### Ambient mesh networking

In ambient mode, the CNI plugin monitors pods and configures networking for the ambient mesh without sidecar injection.

## Docker Official Images vs. Docker Hardened Images

Key differences specific to the Istio CNI DHI:

- **Security hardening**: Minimal attack surface with only essential components
- **Enhanced monitoring**: Built-in SBOM for vulnerability tracking
- **Privileged requirement**: Still requires privileged access for CNI operations

## Image variants

Docker Hardened Images come in different variants depending on their intended use. Runtime variants are designed for
production use and run as a privileged container.

To view the image variants and get more information about them, select the **Tags** tab for this repository.

## Migrate to a Docker Hardened Image

To migrate your Istio CNI deployment, update your DaemonSet or Istio installation configuration:

```yaml
image: dhi.io/istio-install-cni:<tag>
```

Ensure the DaemonSet has appropriate RBAC permissions for pod monitoring and CNI configuration.

## Troubleshooting migration

The following are common issues that you may encounter during migration.

### General debugging

The hardened images intended for runtime don't contain a shell nor any tools for debugging. The recommended method for
debugging applications built with Docker Hardened Images is to use
[Docker Debug](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/debug/) to attach to these containers. Docker Debug provides
a shell, common debugging tools, and lets you install other tools in an ephemeral, writable layer that only exists
during the debugging session.

### Permissions

By default image variants intended for runtime, run as a nonroot user. Ensure that necessary files and directories are
accessible to that user. You may need to copy files to different directories or change permissions so your application
running as a nonroot user can access them.

To view the user for an image variant, select the **Tags** tab for this repository.

### Privileged ports

Non-dev hardened images run as a nonroot user by default. As a result, applications in these images can't bind to
privileged ports (below 1024) when running in Kubernetes or in Docker Engine versions older than 20.10. To avoid issues,
configure your application to listen on port 1025 or higher inside the container, even if you map it to a lower port on
the host. For example, `docker run -p 80:8080 my-image` will work because the port inside the container is 8080, and
`docker run -p 80:81 my-image` won't work because the port inside the container is 81.

### No shell

By default, image variants intended for runtime don't contain a shell. Use `dev` images in build stages to run shell
commands and then copy any necessary artifacts into the runtime stage. In addition, use Docker Debug to debug containers
with no shell.

To see if a shell is available in an image variant and which one, select the **Tags** tab for this repository.

### Entry point

Docker Hardened Images may have different entry points than images such as Docker Official Images.

To view the Entrypoint or CMD defined for an image variant, select the **Tags** tab for this repository, select a tag,
and then select the **Specifications** tab.
