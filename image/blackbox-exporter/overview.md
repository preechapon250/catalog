## About Prometheus Blackbox Exporter

The Prometheus Blackbox Exporter is a versatile probing tool that allows blackbox monitoring of network endpoints
through multiple protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, ICMP, and gRPC. It enables external monitoring of services
by generating Prometheus metrics from probe results, making it essential for monitoring service availability, response
times, TLS certificate expiration, and overall endpoint health. The exporter features a web UI for debugging probes and
supports configuration hot-reloading for dynamic probe management.
