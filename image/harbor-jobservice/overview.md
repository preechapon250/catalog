## About Harbor Job Service

Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the
open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and
management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor
supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management,
access control and activity auditing.

Harbor Job Service is the asynchronous task execution engine for Harbor. It manages and executes background operations
such as image replication, garbage collection, vulnerability scanning, tag retention policies, and scheduled tasks.
